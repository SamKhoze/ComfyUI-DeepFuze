# Models🌟🌟🌟

You can download models directly from [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CNdsf_M1cBLgFIS5HQIqm0lCoW4M4QkL?usp=sharing) and place models into the PATH `./ComfyUI/models/deepfuze/` Ensure to manually download each model one by one and place them, due to the size of the models some of the models won't download if you download the folder preparing the environmental variables navigate into your custom_nodes folder and git clone or manually download the code and extract it into the custom_nodes folder.

## OpenAI API setup for voice cloning (Optional)
---

You need an OpenAI API Key if you wish to use the "DeepFuze Openai LLM" node for generating dialogues for voice cloning
---
To use the "Openai LLM" node for voice cloning dialogues, you need an OpenAI API Key. You can get this key and set it up by following the instructions in the [OpenAI Developer quickstart guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart). Please note that the "Openai LLM" node does not save your API key. Every time you close the node, you will need to manually copy and paste your API key. You can also add the API key as an Environment Variable using the following commands: For Windows: `setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your-api-key-here"`, and for Mac: `export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'`. The next time you need to copy and paste your API key into the LLM Node, you can type the following command in your terminal: `echo $OPENAI_API_KEY`, and it will print your API Key, allowing you to copy and paste it into your Openai LLM node.

![DeepFuze Openai_Node](https://github.com/SamKhoze/ComfyUI-DeepFuze/blob/main/images/DeepFuze_Openai_LLM.jpg)

The "LLM Integration" node is used to incorporate LLM (Language Model) into the voice cloning process. You can input your dialogue and configure parameters, and the AI-generated texts will be employed for voice cloning. Furthermore, you can utilize this node in place of ChatGPT to produce text from LLM or to ask any questions in the same manner as you would with ChatGPT. You can view the output of the DeepFuze_LLM by connecting the LLM_RESPONSE to the "Display Any" node from [rgthree-comfy](https://github.com/rgthree/rgthree-comfy) this node also can be used for prompt generations and any nodes input texts. 

**Input Types:**
- `user_query`: Type your dialogues.

**Output Types:**
- `LLM_RESPONSE`: Outputs AI Generated texts.

**DeepFuze Openai LLM Features:**
- `model_name`: You can select from the available openai models.
- `api_key`: Add your API Key. (Your API Key will not be saved, each time you use this node you must manually enter it.
- `max_tokens`: is a parameter that limits the number of tokens in a model's response in OpenAI GPT APIs. It's used in requests made through GPT for Sheets and Docs, and in the ChatOpenAI() class. The default value for max_tokens is 4096 tokens, which is roughly equivalent to 3,000 words.
- `temperature`: controls the level of randomness and creativity in its responses. It's a hyper-parameter in Large Language Models (LLMs) that balances creativity and coherence in the generated text. The temperature setting is always a number between 0 and 1, with the default being 0.7:
0: Produces very straightforward, almost deterministic responses
1: Results in wildly varying responses
0.7: The default temperature for ChatGPT.
- `timeout` : set up time if the request takes too long to complete and the server closes the connection.
